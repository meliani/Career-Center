Current Outstanding Issue:
ðŸ”´ Redis Extension Missing: PHP Redis extension not installed in Dockerfile.dev

Last Actions Taken:
Added Redis installation to Dockerfile.dev:
Started rebuild process: docker-compose -f [docker-compose.dev.yml](http://_vscodecontentref_/5) build --no-cache app
Next Steps Needed:
Complete the container rebuild (may still be running)
Start containers: docker-compose -f [docker-compose.dev.yml](http://_vscodecontentref_/6) up -d
Verify Redis is installed: docker-compose -f [docker-compose.dev.yml](http://_vscodecontentref_/7) exec app php -m | grep redis
Test Laravel application functionality
Working Configuration:
Containers: career-center-app-dev, career-center-nginx-dev, career-center-db-dev
Local Package: Successfully mounted and detected
Database: All 88 migrations completed
Performance: Optimized for Windows Docker environment
The main remaining task is completing the Redis extension installation to resolve the "Class 'Redis' not found" error.
