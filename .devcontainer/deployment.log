Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.

    - openspout/openspout is locked to version v4.30.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - openspout/openspout v4.30.0 requires ext-zip * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's zip extension.
  Problem 4
    - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet is locked to version 1.29.10 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet 1.29.10 requires ext-gd * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gd extension.

    - spatie/laravel-backup is locked to version 9.3.3 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - spatie/laravel-backup 9.3.3 requires ext-zip ^1.14.0 -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's zip extension.
  Problem 6
    - webklex/php-imap is locked to version 5.5.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - webklex/php-imap 5.5.0 requires ext-zip * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's zip extension.
  Problem 7
    - filament/widgets is locked to version v3.3.20 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - filament/support v3.3.20 requires ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - filament/widgets v3.3.20 requires filament/support v3.3.20 -> satisfiable by filament/support[v3.3.20].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - /usr/local/php/8.4.8/ini/php.ini
    - /usr/local/php/8.4.8/ini/conf.d/xdebug.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd --ignore-platform-req=ext-zip` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
